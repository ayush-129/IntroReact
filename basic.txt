React is Frontend Library of Javascript.
Created by facebook to ease the UI UPDATION.
It used to make COMPONRNTS which combines HTML and logic into a single resuable function.
Morethan an individual Library, React is an ecosystem which involves webpack,babble,server and much more.
Its not as simple as u can include or import React scripts in javascript file.

------------------------------------ USING CREATE REACT APP ----------------------------------------
On installation it carries package.json file. It has many dependencies.
It has a dependency named react-scripts which has 48 other sub-dependencies such as webpack,babble.

We make changes to App.js file:
we are returning the html(components) inside the javascript file. HOW its happening ????
we write these components inside the APP FUNCTION which KNOW how to render them into HTML.

It uses JSX(Syntax Extension for Javascript) which allows to write markup that looks like HTML directly inside our JS.
Its not legal JS on its own, so its must be transpiled into real javascript.
*BABLE is the transpiler which converts the JSX to real JS.
Real Javascript is rendered to browser(babble does this job)

app.js file has APP is the top level component in the entire application. (WORKSPACEE)
index.html file has empty div of id=root : it the place where all the react components will be rendered.
index.js file : Selects that div and app component is rendered inside that id=root.


Creating components:(initialising the component)
its basically a function which return JSX (behind the scenes the transpiler(Bable) converts the JSX into real Javascript)
function Greeter(){
    return <h1> Creating Comp </h1>
}

Rendering components:(using the component): <Greeter/>
export default function App(){
    return(
        <div clasName="App">
            <Greeter/>
        </div>
    )
}

--------------------- For running codes in local computer ---------------------------------
Compiler of C++: GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)
Interpreter of Javascript: V8: Developed by Google, V8 is one of the fastest JavaScript engines and serves as the runtime for Google Chrome and Chromium-based browsers
Node.js is not an interpreter itself but rather a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a web browser.

----------------- Industry level recommendations (pick frameworks) ----------------------------------
If you want to build a new app or a new website fully with React, we recommend picking one of the React-powered frameworks popular in the community. eg:NEXT.js is the framework of React.
Production-grade React frameworks: NEXT.js, Remix, Gatsby, Expo (for native apps).

------------------ Can I use React without a framework? (Yes, pick bundlers) -----------------------
Grab react and react-dom from npm, set up your custom build process with a bundler like VITE or PARCEL or WEBPACK, and add other tools as you need them for routing, static generation or server-side rendering, and more.
A bundler is a tool used in web development to bundle or package together various files and dependencies of a web application into a single file or a few files. This bundling process typically involves combining JavaScript, CSS, and other assets into bundles that can be efficiently served to the browser

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
react + react-dom: used in web application
react+ react-native: used im mobile application

------------------- BASIC REACT APP -----------------
npm: node package manager (installs the uses the stuffs)
npx: node package executer (doesnot install the stuffs, it directly executes)
--- npx create-react-app ---
create-react-app is very bulky utility

React is single Page application(SPA)
